# The Basics of Bayesian Statistics

Bayesian statistics mostly involves **conditional probability**, which is the the probability of an event A **given** event B, and it can be calculated using the Bayes rule. The concept of conditional probability is widely used in medical testing, in which false positives and false negatives may occur. A false positive can be defined as a positive outcome on a medical test when the patient does not actually have the disease they are being tested for. In other words, it's the probability of testing positive given no disease. Similarly, a false negative can be defined as a negative outcome on a medical test when the patient does have the disease. In other words, testing negative given disease. Both indicators are critical for any medical decisions.

For how the Bayes' rule is applied, we can set up a prior, then calculate posterior probabilities based on a prior and likelihood. That is to say, the prior probabilities are updated through an iterative process of data collection.
